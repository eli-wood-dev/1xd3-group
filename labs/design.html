                One example of a website with poor design is <a href="https://arngren.net/">arngren.net</a>.
                This site breaks several rules of modern web design, and design in general.
                Specifically, this site breaks the rules of design laid out in the textbook.
                We will go over each of these rules and provide example of why this site breaks each rule.

            <h2>Error Prevention</h2>
            <p>
                Fortunately for this site, there are no major issues with error prevention, with the only things that could be considered an error is some errors in the console.
                Even then, the errors are relatively minor, with the only subsantial error is the lack of a favicon for the website due to a 404 error.
