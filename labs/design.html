                One example of a website with poor design is <a href="https://arngren.net/">arngren.net</a>.
                This site breaks several rules of modern web design, and design in general.
                Specifically, this site breaks the rules of design laid out in the <a href="https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/webdev/chapter/user-interface-design/">textbook</a>.
                We will go over each of these rules and provide example of why this site breaks each rule.
            </p>
            <h3>Consistency</h3>
            <p>
                This website has very poor consistency, where text has random colours with seemingly no reason.
                Another issue is that when navigating to a different page the layout is completely different with the menu looking nothing like the main page.
                Another issue is that when switching the language from Norwegian to English the layout of the site breaks, and some of the colours change.
            </p>
            <h3>Ease of Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                This site is incredibly difficult to navigate, because almost everything is a link, with so indication that it can be clicked other than the cursor becoming a pointer.
                It is also difficult to navigate because many pages do not have links back to the main page, so if you click on them there is no easy way to go back.
            </p>
            <h3>Universal Usability and Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
                This website is not very accessible, with one example being that the images do not have any alt text.
                Most of the images are actually links, and instead of alt text it shows where the link leads.
                This is not a perfect alternative, because it is important to describe what the image is showing.
                The font is also very small, especially on small devices like phones.
                This leads into another issue, where the mobile view (and even the desktop view) requires horizontal scrolling to see all of the content.
                This is especially bad for mobile, where the content is very small, and does not entirely fit on the screen.
                This makes navigation difficult, as the links are very small and close together, so the user may accidentally click on the wrong link.
            </p>
            <h3>Error Prevention</h3>
            <p>
                Fortunately for this site, there are no major issues with error prevention, with the only things that could be considered an error is some errors in the console.
                Even then, the errors are relatively minor, with the only subsantial error is the lack of a favicon for the website due to a 404 error.
            </p>
            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>
                I think this design is an example of what not to do when designing a webpage, with many flaws.
                Looking into the site in developer mode, there are some things we can see which indicate why this site is like this.
                I believe that this site was likely made with a site builder tool, and not manually programmed, so the developer likely just made a layout which worked on their computer and didn't check it with other sizes.
                It is also likely that this website was made a long time ago when websites in general were lower quality without a focus on mobile design.
                One way this website could be improved would be to remake it with flexboxes or css grid to have a more responsive design, instead of using absolute positions with overlapping images.

                One example of a website with good design is <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/">apple.com</a>.
                This site follows several rules of modern web design, and design in general.
                Specifically, this site follows the rules of design laid out in the <a href="https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/webdev/chapter/user-interface-design/">textbook</a>.
                We will go over each of these rules and provide example of why this site follows each rule.
            </p>
            <h3>Consistency</h3>
            <p>
                Apple's (or more specifically, Apple Canada's) site is very consistent across all of its pages.
                The navigation bar is consistently at the same position on every page, and the fonts, colours, and layout styles remain the same throughout the site.
                For example, all the product pages follow a similar structure with large images, bold headings, and simple buttons like “Learn more” or “Buy.”
                This makes the site easy to understand because users do not have to relearn how the site works each time they navigate between pages.    
            </p>
            <h3>Ease of Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                The website is easy to navigate because the main menu clearly lists all major product categories such as Mac, iPad, iPhone, and Watch.
                These options are always visible at the top of the page, allowing users to quickly access what they are looking for.
                In addition, the links are clearly labeled and spaced out, making it obvious to what is clickable.
                This follows the design principle that users should be able to find information quickly without confusion.
            </p>
            <h3>Universal Usability and Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
                Apple’s site supports universal usability by using very large text, super clear headings, and high contrast between text and background colours.
                This makes the content easier to read on different devices, including phones, tablets, and personal computers.
                Many images also include alternative text, which helps screen readers describe the content to users with visual impairments.
                However, the site relies heavily on scrolling, which may make it harder for some users to quickly find specific information quickly.

            </p>
            <h3>Error Prevention</h3>
            <p>
                The website does a good job of preventing user errors by guiding users through clear actions.
                Buttons like “Learn more” and “Buy” are clearly separated, therefore reducing the chance of clicking the unwanted option.
                There are also no visible error messages during normal use of the site, meaning users are not interrupted by any technical issues while visiting.
                This creates a smooth and frustration-free experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>
                Overall, apple.com is a strong example of good web design.
                The site follows the four design principles by being consistent, easy to navigate, accessible to many users, and effective at preventing errors.
                While the large promotional sections may require a lot of scrolling, the design is still very clear and user-friendly.
                This makes it a good example of how modern websites should be designed, albeit a little extreme at times.
