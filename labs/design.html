            <p>
                One example of a website with poor design is <a href="https://arngren.net/">arngren.net</a>.
                This site breaks several rules of modern web design, and design in general.
                Specifically, this site breaks the rules of design laid out in the textbook.
                We will go over each of these rules and provide example of why this site breaks each rule.
            </p>
            <h3>Consistency</h3>
            <p>
                This website has very poor consistency, where text has random colours with seemingly no reason.
                Another issue is that when navigating to a different page the layout is completely different with the menu looking nothing like the main page.
                Another issue is that when switching the language from Norwegian to English the layout of the site breaks, and some of the colours change.
            </p>
            <h3>Ease of Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                This site is incredibly difficult to navigate, because almost everything is a link, with so indication that it can be clicked other than the cursor becoming a pointer.
                It is also difficult to navigate because many pages do not have links back to the main page, so if you click on them there is no easy way to go back.
            </p>
            <h3>Universal Usability and Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
                This website is not very accessible, with one example being that the images do not have any alt text.
                Most of the images are actually links, and instead of alt text it shows where the link leads.
                This is not a perfect alternative, because it is important to describe what the image is showing.
                The font is also very small, especially on small devices like phones.
                This leads into another issue, where the mobile view (and even the desktop view) requires horizontal scrolling to see all of the content.
                This is especially bad for mobile, where the content is very small, and does not entirely fit on the screen.
                This makes navigation difficult, as the links are very small and close together, so the user may accidentally click on the wrong link.
            </p>
            <h3>Error Prevention</h3>
            <p>
                Fortunately for this site, there are no major issues with error prevention, with the only things that could be considered an error is some errors in the console.
                Even then, the errors are relatively minor, with the only subsantial error is the lack of a favicon for the website due to a 404 error.
